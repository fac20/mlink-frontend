## Sprint One

## Sprint Two

## Installation

## Bugs

- [ ] Dropdown feature in Profile
<details>
<summary> How to fix this:</summary>
- Set a unique state for each component that's using the dropdown
</details>
- [ ]
- [ ]

## Next Steps

- [ ] Fix all the above bugs
- [ ] Use a GraphQl client like [URQL](https://formidable.com/open-source/urql/) or
      [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/) for state management to easily fetch, cache, and modify application data,
      while automatically updating the UI.
- [ ] Set up authorisation and social login with [Auth0](https://auth0.com/)
- [ ] Error handling - Create appropriate display messages for when the user encounters unexpected conditions
- [ ] Configure CORS on Hasura to be specific to certain domains and subdomains (it's currently default which is \*)
